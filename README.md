# README

This is the README file for the project that describes the creation of the Netflix logo using HTML and CSS.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS

## Description

In this project, the Netflix logo was created using HTML and CSS. The goal was to replicate the appearance of the logo using code only, without the use of images. HTML elements and CSS stylings were used to construct the shape and colors of the logo.

## Implementation Steps

The implementation of the Netflix logo in HTML and CSS can be divided into several main steps:

1. HTML Structure: A basic HTML structure was created to define the main container of the logo and its inner elements.

2. CSS Styling: CSS stylings were applied to create the visual appearance of the logo. This included the use of properties such as `border-radius`, `background-color`, `box-shadow`, and `transform` to define the shapes, colors, and shadows of the logo.

3. Responsiveness: Responsive design techniques were applied to ensure that the logo adjusts properly to different screen sizes and devices.

## How to Run

To view the Netflix logo created using HTML and CSS, follow the steps below:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local environment.

2. Navigate to the directory where the files are located.

3. Open the `index.html` file in a compatible web browser.

4. The Netflix logo will be displayed on the opened page.

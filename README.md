# Netflix Logo
A "Netflix logo" with HTML and CSS is a visual representation of the Netflix logo created using these markup and styling languages. HTML is used to structure the markup of the logo, while CSS is used to style it.

In the provided example, we use a <div> element to wrap the Netflix logo, and an <svg> element to draw the logo in vector format. The xmlns attribute defines the SVG namespace, and the viewBox attribute defines the dimensions and aspect ratio of the logo. The fill attribute determines the filled color of the logo.

In CSS, we apply some rules for the positioning and appearance of the logo. We set a bottom margin for the <div> element to ensure some space between the logo and adjacent content. The display: inline-block and vertical-align: middle are applied to the <svg> element to make the logo displayed inline and vertically aligned at the center of the <div>.
